Their performance was a tribute to those who lost everything, accompanied by heart-wrenching photos of devastated homeowners.

#### **Billy Crystal’s Emotional Tribute**
Billy Crystal, the night's first host, appeared in the same clothes he wore while fleeing his family home, now reduced to ashes in the Palisades Fire. With his trademark humor and tender heart, he shared a tale of another time of national sorrow. Recalling the Concert for New York City after 9/11, Crystal painted a vivid picture of grieving attendees holding signs of missing loved ones. 

*“And tonight, here I am, speaking to you in pain,”* he said. *“But I’m also one of the thousands asking, ‘Have you seen my school?’ ‘Have you seen my church?’ ‘Have you seen my house?’ ‘Have you seen my town?’ ‘Have you seen the 29 people who lost their lives?’”*

Reflecting on the courage of firefighters, police officers, and first responders, Crystal expressed profound gratitude. He recounted returning to his destroyed home, where he wept with a grief he hadn’t felt since losing his father. Amidst the wreckage, his daughters found a rock engraved with the word *“Laughter,”* a beacon of hope in the darkness.

*“We’ll laugh again,”* he reassured. *“Let’s show the world who we are: We’re Los Angeles, one city, one heart. L.A. Strong!”*
